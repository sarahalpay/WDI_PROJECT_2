# WDI PROJECT 2

The second project was to build a full-stack RESTful Express app that uses a Mongo database and that includes authentication.

## Technical Requirements:

* Have at _least_ 2 models – one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of the app
* Incude relationships - embedded or referenced. 
* App should include authentication - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of the resources with all CRUD actions.
* Must use SCSS
* Include wireframes
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

## Necessary Deliverables:

* A working full-stack application - hosted Heroku
* A link to your hosted working app - in the URL section of your Github repo.
* A git repository hosted on Github - with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* Wireframes of your app.

### Name of App:

ObsCouture

### App purpose:

The purpose/idea of the app is to provide a platform for discovering and supporting unknown clothing designers to users (the wider public)


## Technologies used:

* HTML5
* SCSS
* EJS
* Express
* Mongoose
* Bluebird
* Node.js

## Approach taken:

*to put in Approach section:
I sketched some wireframes before I started and wrote user stories to define what my users would want to do with the app.*

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.

* **User stories and/or wireframes define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what ot build.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
* 
Did some online research in order to determine which game I wanted to build.
Planned my game by drawing out how it would look and what it should do.
Once I had the wireframes for my game, I pseudo-coded all the basic elements of my game.
I then approached my actual code one step at a time. I first started out with the HTML content. I then moved on to my game layout with CSS (no styling at this point). Once I was happy with those elements, I then moved on to jQuery and started building my code up little by little (created a function to move my spaceship, then moved on to creating one planet and getting that planet to move down the page. Once I had achieved that, I then added more functionality within my function to randomly create more planets and so on so forth...).
Once I had my basic game working, I then slowly added more functionality to my game such as adding collision detection, more levels to my game, audio and local storage for the high score.
The final part of my project was to add styling elements to my game using CSS, DOM manipulation and code refactoring.

## Unsolved problems/potential improvements:
* Create a link which directs users to the brand's website.
* Create a "shop the look" feature.
* Potentially include data from an API - to make my app more dynamic.
* Would like to add automated tests for at least ONE of my RESTful resources.
