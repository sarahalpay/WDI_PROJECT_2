# WDI PROJECT 2

The second project was to build a full-stack RESTful Express app that uses a Mongo database and that includes authentication.

## Technical Requirements:

* Have at _least_ 2 models â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of the app
* Include relationships - embedded or referenced.
* App should include authentication - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of the resources with all CRUD actions.
* Must use SCSS
* Include wireframes
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

## Necessary Deliverables:

* A working full-stack application - hosted Heroku
* A link to your hosted working app - in the URL section of your Github repo.
* A git repository hosted on Github - with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* Wireframes of your app.

### Name of App:

ObsCouture

### App concept:

The app concept is to give undiscovered designers a platform where they can connect with a global audience and showcase their designs from anywhere in the world at no cost.
Users can browse designers/brands by categories and "favourite" a brand - which is then stored on the user's profile for future reference.


## Technologies used:

* HTML5
* SCSS
* EJS
* Express
* Mongoose
* Bluebird
* Node.js
* Bootstrap

## Approach taken:

* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.**
* I planned out my application by firstly sketching some wireframes and wrote user stories to define what my users would want to do with the app. I also drew on some inspiration from other applications that I use and like (such as instagram and LIKEtoKNOW.it). I then made a to do list for what needed to get done.

* I first started with the user authentication and tested this in Insomnia. Once that was working, I moved on to doing all the back-end elements of the application and continued testing my routes and controllers in Insomnia. Once those elements were working, I finally moved on to the front-end and styling using Bootstrap.

* I pseudo-coded all the basic elements of my application and built from there.![]()

## Unsolved problems/potential improvements:
* Create a link which directs users to the brand's website.
* Create a "shop the look" feature.
* Potentially include data from an API - to make my app more dynamic.
* Would like to add automated tests for at least ONE of my RESTful resources.
